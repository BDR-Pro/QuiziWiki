## üß† pageFiller: The Engine Behind Content Creation

At the heart of Quizify lies `pageFiller`, an innovative script designed to seamlessly bridge the worlds of philosophy, technology history, and the future with our learning platform. It dives into Wikipedia, fetching article summaries, categorizing knowledge, and dissecting sections to fuel our quiz-generation engine.

### How It Works:
- **Fetch and Analyze**: `pageFiller` taps into Wikipedia, extracting summaries, categories, and key sections from articles, starting with a deep dive into "Philosophy".
- **MongoDB Integration**: It doesn't just stop at analysis. Each piece of information, from article summaries to categories, is meticulously organized and stored in MongoDB, ensuring a rich database of knowledge.
- **Expand Your Horizon**: With `pageFiller`, we're constantly expanding our repository, covering everything from the roots of philosophical thought to the cutting-edge future of technology.

### Dive Deeper:
Our journey begins with an exploration of "Philosophy", where `pageFiller` meticulously categorizes each subdomain and fetches detailed summaries. This process not only enriches our content but also lays the groundwork for quizzes that challenge and inspire.

By integrating MongoDB, `pageFiller` ensures that every piece of knowledge is preserved, categorized, and ready to transform into engaging quizzes. It's how we're building a dynamic, ever-growing platform for learning.

## üéì Advanced Content Generation with Hugging Face API

Quizify has evolved! We're now harnessing the power of the Hugging Face API to elevate our quiz content creation. This cutting-edge tool allows us to generate detailed questions and answers based on Wikipedia summaries, complete with distractors for a comprehensive quiz experience.

### How It Works:
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Utilizing `https://huggingface.co/spaces/bader4k/question-gen-en`, Quizify dynamically generates quiz questions and multiple-choice answers directly from Wikipedia article summaries.
- **JSON-Powered Insights**: Each quiz question is crafted with precision, offering insights like this:
```json
{
  "page_title": "-ene",
  "summary": "The suffix -ene is used in organic chemistry...",
  "question": "Why would a Greek number suffix be inserted before the suffix -ene?",
  "choices": ["[A] to say that the double bond is between that atom and the next number up", "[B]...", "[C]...", "[D] to say that the double bond is between that atom and the atom with the next number up [ANSWER]"]
}
```
- **Loop Through Documents**: Our script navigates through all MongoDB documents, extracting titles and summaries to feed into the Hugging Face API, enriching our database with ready-to-use quiz content.

### Step into the Future of Learning:
