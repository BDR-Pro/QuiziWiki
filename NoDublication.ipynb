This prototype was rejected in 1957 for failing to meet several of the technical requirements for accuracy and reliability. A later prototype of Garanin relied on gas operation; this one was rejected in 1960, because it was considered inferior to the front-runner designs of Nikitin and Kalashnikov.

In 1923 the PO began electrification of the 200 km section of the Toulouse main line from Paris to Vierzon using a supply of 1,500 V DC. The Ganz Works of Budapest, Hungary supplied these two locomotives, to the design of Kálmán Kandó.The arrangement of the locomotives was unusual for DC locomotives and may have been influenced by Kandó's other designs for AC locomotives, with the large diameter frame-mounted AC motors of the period. The four motors were mounted rigidly on the frames, above the driving wheels. Each motor drove an external jackshaft crank, with the four driving axles coupled in pairs. Drive between the motor jackshafts and the wheels was by coupling rods.  As express passenger locomotives, this also permitted large diameter driving wheels, rather than small-wheeled bogies beneath the frames. Suspension travel between the driven wheels and the fixed motors was achieved through Kandó's triangular linkage design.The coupled wheels, rather than individual traction motors, encouraged resistance to wheelslip. This advantage was recognised and influenced future French designs, such as the typically French monomotor bogie rather than the axle-hung traction motors used elsewhere.In service, the locomotives proved fast and powerful, but were unreliable. When other passenger locomotives became available, they were restricted to freight work at up to 80 kilometres per hour (50 mph). Despite this they were popular with their crews, encouraged by the French practice of attaching crews to the same locomotive. They gained the class nickname, Les Belles Hongroisses. Their later years were spent in freight-only service based at Limoges. They survived into SNCF service until 1938, keeping their original numbers, but were withdrawn and scrapped that year.\", 'categories': {'Category:1500 V DC locomotives': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1500_V_DC_locomotives', 'Category:2-B-B-2 locomotives': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2-B-B-2_locomotives', 'Category:All articles needing additional references': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references', 'Category:Articles needing additional references from December 2015': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_December_2015', 'Category:Articles with short description': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_short_description', 'Category:Commons category link from Wikidata': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Commons_category_link_from_Wikidata', 'Category:Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans locomotives': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Compagnie_du_chemin_de_fer_de_Paris_%C3%A0_Orl%C3%A9ans_locomotives', 'Category:Passenger locomotives': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Passenger_locomotives', 'Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1926': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Railway_locomotives_introduced_in_1926', 'Category:Scrapped locomotives': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Scrapped_locomotives', 'Category:Short description is different from Wikidata': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Short_description_is_different_from_Wikidata', 'Category:Standard gauge electric locomotives of France': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Standard_gauge_electric_locomotives_of_France'}, 'question': 'Question: Who first ordered the 2BB2 400 class?', 'A': 'SNCF', 'B': 'The Paris Orléans Railway', 'C': 'The Ganz Works [ANSWER]', 'D': 'Kálmán Kandó'}\n",

It may refer to the branch of computer science that comprises such techniques or to the models themselves.\\n\\n2D computer graphics are mainly used in applications that were originally developed upon traditional printing and drawing technologies, such as typography, cartography, technical drawing, advertising, etc.  In those applications, the two-dimensional image is not just a representation of a real-world object, but an independent artifact with added semantic value; two-dimensional models are therefore preferred, because they give more direct control of the image than 3D computer graphics (whose approach is more akin to photography than to typography).\\nIn many domains, such as desktop publishing, engineering, and business, a description of a document based on 2D computer graphics techniques can be much smaller than the corresponding digital image—often by a factor of 1/1000 or more.  This representation is also more flexible since it can be rendered at different resolutions to suit different output devices.  For these reasons, documents and illustrations are often stored or transmitted as 2D graphic files.\\n2D computer graphics started in the 1950s, based on vector graphics devices. These were largely supplanted by raster-based devices in the following decades. The PostScript language and the X Window System protocol were landmark developments in the field.\\n2D graphics models may combine geometric models (also called vector graphics), digital images (also called raster graphics), text to be typeset (defined by content, font style and size, color, position, and orientation), mathematical functions and equations, and more.  These components can be modified and manipulated by two-dimensional geometric transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling.\\nIn object-oriented graphics, the image is described indirectly by an object endowed with a self-rendering method—a procedure that assigns colors to the image pixels by an arbitrary algorithm.

It is considered part of the Classical era, epoch, or historical period. \\nEarly in the century, the Roman Empire attained its greatest expansion under the emperor Trajan, but after his death became primarily defensive for the rest of its history. Much prosperity took place throughout the empire at this time, ruled as it was by the \"Five Good Emperors\", a succession of well-received and able rulers. This period also saw the removal of the Jews from Jerusalem during the reign of Hadrian after Bar Kokhba\\'s revolt.\\nThe last quarter of the century saw the end of the period of peace and prosperity known as the Pax Romana at the death of the emperor Marcus Aurelius, last of the \"Five Good Emperors\", and the ascension of Commodus. After Commodus was murdered in 192, a turbulent period known as the Year of the Five Emperors ensued. After the quick successive removals of Pertinax and Didius Julianus from power, this period had the general-turned-emperor Septimius Severus, who was the founder of the Severan dynasty, pitted against rival claimants in the form of Pescennius Niger. Severus\\' forces defeated the rival claimants at the Battle of Issus in 194, and Clodius Albinus, whom he defeated at the Battle of Lugdunum in 197, granting Severus sole authority over the empire.Although the Han dynasty of China was firmly cemented into power and extended its imperial influence into Central Asia during the first half of the century, by the second half there was widespread corruption and open rebellion. This led to its decline, and in September 189, the Han general Dong Zhuo, after being summoned to the capital by He Jin to help quell the corrupt and powerful eunuch faction by serving as an intimidator to both them and the Empress Dowager, marched his army into Luoyang in light of He Jin\\'s assassination and the subsequent slaughter of the eunuchs, taking over the capital and effectively becoming the de facto head of the government.\\nWarlords and government officials quickly took against him in a campaign that, while failing to put him down, compelled Dong Zhuo to shift the seat of imperial power further west to Chang\\'an. As Dong Zhuo was killed in 192, the chaos in the wake of the collapse of centralized authority only continued, with various warlords attempting to vie for supremacy in order to establish or hold onto their authority within the decaying empire. Meanwhile, Dong Zhuo\\'s former followers Li Jue and Guo Si were left to squabble amongst themselves, while Emperor Xian himself fled and returned to the ravaged city of Luoyang. In 196, he was given refuge by the warlord Cao Cao, who relocated him to the new capital city of Xu, from where he could control the emperor. Cao Cao would further exert his authority by defeating the powerful warlord Yuan Shao at the decisive Battle of Guandu in 200.', 'categories': {'Category:1st millennium': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1st_millennium', 'Category:2nd century': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2nd_century', 'Category:All articles needing additional references': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references', 'Category:Articles needing additional references from July 2019': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_July_2019', 'Category:Articles with NKC identifiers': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_NKC_identifiers', 'Category:Articles with short description': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_short_description', 'Category:Centuries': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Centuries', 'Category:Short description matches Wikidata': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Short_description_matches_Wikidata'}, 'question': 'Question: When was the emperor Trajan killed?', 'A': 'in AD 196', 'B': 'around 192 [ANSWER]', 'C': 'around 189', 'D': 'in AD 101'}\n",

In the context of the Eastern Mediterranean, it is the mid-point of the Hellenistic period.\\nFresh from its victories in the Second Punic War, the Roman Republic continued its expansion in the western Mediterranean, campaigning in the Iberian peninsula throughout the century and annexing the North African coast after the destruction of the city of Carthage at the end of the Third Punic War. They became the dominant force in the Aegean by destroying Antigonid Macedonia in the Macedonian Wars and Corinth in the Achaean War. The Hellenistic kingdoms of Ptolemaic Egypt and Attalid Pergamon entered into subordinate relationships with the Romans – Pergamon was eventually annexed. The end of the century witnessed the evolution of the Roman army from a citizen army into a voluntary professional force, which later scholars would misattribute to putative reforms by noted general and statesman Gaius Marius (the so-called Marian Reforms).\\nIn the Near East, the other major Hellenistic kingdom, the Seleucid Empire collapsed into civil war in the middle of the century, following the loss of Asia Minor to the Romans and the conquest of the Iranian plateau and Mesopotamia by the Parthian empire. Outlying regions became independent kingdoms, notably the Hasmonean kingdom in Judaea.\\nIn East Asia, China reached a high point under the Han dynasty. The Han Empire extended its boundaries from Korea in the east to Vietnam in the South to the borders of modern-day Kazakhstan in the west. The nomadic Xiongnu were at the height of their power at the beginning of the century, collecting tribute from the Han. Their victories over the Yuezhi set off a chain of westward migrations in Central Asia. Han efforts to find allies against the Xiongnu by exploring the lands to their west would ultimately lead to the opening of the Silk Road.In South Asia, the Mauryan Empire in India collapsed when Brihadnatha, the last emperor, was killed by Pushyamitra Shunga, a Mauryan general who founded of the Shunga Empire.

The founding members--consisting of Joe Ewers, Fred Ewers, John Frayler, Dave Goss and Bob Beeman-- were amateurs who played a variety of 19th-century instruments, including banjo, bones, drum, fiddle, guitar, and tambourine. They began by playing informally during re-enactment campaigns. They eventually moved to playing dances and concerts. Today, the roster comprises seven members, including players of the fife, flute, and pennywhistle.The 2nd South Carolina String Band has released six albums through Palmetto Productions. Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has featured their music in his films Mark Twain and Jazz. The band appears in the film Gods and Generals, directed by Ronald F. Maxwell, and their music appears on the soundtrack. In November 2004, the band received the Stephen Collins Foster Award for their preservation of 19th-century American song. The band\\'s current personnel includes: Joe Ewers (banjo), Fred Ewers (fiddle), Dave Goss (guitar), Bob Beeman (tambourine & bones), Mike Paul (fiddle), Joe Whitney (flute) and Tom DiGiuseppe (banjo).Past band members have included Marty Grody (fife, tin whistle), John Frayler (military drum), and Greg Hernandez (fife).The band is now retired.', 'categories': {'Category:All articles needing additional references': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references', 'Category:American Civil War reenactment': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:American_Civil_War_reenactment', 'Category:American folk musical groups': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:American_folk_musical_groups', 'Category:Articles needing additional references from May 2022': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_May_2022', 'Category:Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_MusicBrainz_identifiers', 'Category:Historical reenactment groups': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Historical_reenactment_groups', 'Category:Musical groups established in 1989': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Musical_groups_established_in_1989'}, 'question': 'Question: Who has the band portrayed in films?', 'A': 'Stephen Collins Foster', 'B': 'Ken Burns [ANSWER]', 'C': 'Ronald F.

It released the album First Steps, which has been re-released on Blueprint Records (Voiceprint Group) in 2006.\\nThe roots of 2nd Vision were sown in 1977 when Sanders invited keyboard player Dave Bristow and drummer Mickey Barker, both of whom he\\'d already played with in his Birmingham days, to form an improvising unit named Surrounding Silence, which debuted at the Riverside Jazz Festival in August 1977.\\nAfter Etheridge and ex-Gryphon bassist Jonathan Davie joined them, the band, renamed 20/20 Vision, played a well-received gig at the Alexandra Palace in May 1979. The band were offered a management deal by Jo Lustig, who had already represented the likes of Richard Thompson, Pentangle and the Chieftains, and signed with Chrysalis, recording their debut LP in the autumn of 1979, with John Cameron producing. The material was composed by either Sanders or Bristow, with Etheridge contributing one piece, a new version of his Soft Machine solo acoustic guitar piece \"Etika\".\\n\"It was a jazz-rock group, in the mould of Weather Report, Mahavishnu, that kind of things\", Etheridge remembered. \"The one album we made was a very good record. It sounds dated now of course, because it was done using the Yamaha CS-80... But of all the records that I\\'ve made, it\\'s the one that the most trouble was taken over making. I was very pleased with the guitar on it, we took a lot of time to do it. I was quite happy with that... But this was in the late 70\\'s, so it was all punk and new-wave...\".\\nThe album was launched with a four-night residency at London\\'s Riverside Studios in Hammersmith on 7–10 May 1980, with a different guest (Richard Thompson, Gordon Giltrap, Jethro Tull\\'s David Palmer, June Tabor) joining the band each night. Unfortunately, all the British music papers went on strike for several weeks, so there was almost no coverage of the event, and the album failed to sell.\\nThere was an attempt to continue the band with a revised line-up, including bassist Fred Thelonious Baker and drummer Nick Twyman (his predecessor Barker would go on to join heavy-metal band Magnum in 1985), which toured the UK extensively as the John Etheridge/Ric Sanders Group in May 1981, but sadly this was to be its swansong.', 'categories': {'Category:All articles needing additional references': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references', 'Category:All stub articles': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_stub_articles', 'Category:Articles needing additional references from June 2022': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_June_2022', 'Category:Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_MusicBrainz_identifiers', 'Category:Articles with hCards': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards', 'Category:Articles with short description': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_short_description', 'Category:British jazz-rock groups': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:British_jazz-rock_groups', 'Category:Short description is different from Wikidata': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Short_description_is_different_from_Wikidata', 'Category:United Kingdom musical group stubs': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:United_Kingdom_musical_group_stubs', 'Category:Use dmy dates from August 2019': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_August_2019'}, 'question': 'Question: What band did JC join in 1981?', 'A': 'Surrounding Silence', 'B': '2nd Vision', 'C': 'Weather Report', 'D': 'Magnum [ANSWER]'}\n",

Full broadcasting began on 1 November 1989. The network's programming was initially composed of half-hour and more advertising blocks, modern Soviet and Western music videos, cartoons, and TV series. \\nBroadcasting of 2×2 on Channel 3 ended on 9 June 1997, moving to the decimeter band, on Channel 51, where it broadcast with extremely low-quality content and had a much greater focus on home shopping. In 2003, the channel shifted to 60 TVK.Since 1 April 2007, under this name, an animated Russian channel has been broadcasting, aimed at an teen and adult audience 12–102 years old. Its database contains more than 200 titles of various animated series, game shows and feature films. The channel also has its own animation studio.\\nSince 2014, the channel has been part of the holding company Gazprom-Media. As of April 2017, it employs 45 people. The channel applied for inclusion in the second multiplex of digital terrestrial television in Russia, but failed to win the competition held by the Federal Competition Commission (FCC).\", 'categories': {'Category:All Wikipedia articles needing cleanup after translation': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_Wikipedia_articles_needing_cleanup_after_translation', 'Category:All articles needing additional references': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references', 'Category:Anime and Cartoon television': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Anime_and_Cartoon_television', 'Category:Anime television': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Anime_television', 'Category:Articles containing Russian-language text': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Russian-language_text', 'Category:Articles needing additional references from November 2016': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_November_2016', 'Category:Articles needing translation from Russian Wikipedia': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_translation_from_Russian_Wikipedia', 'Category:Articles using infobox television channel': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_using_infobox_television_channel', 'Category:Articles with Russian-language sources (ru)': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_Russian-language_sources_(ru)', 'Category:Articles with short description': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_short_description', 'Category:CS1 Russian-language sources (ru)': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:CS1_Russian-language_sources_(ru)', 'Category:CS1 uses Russian-language script (ru)': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:CS1_uses_Russian-language_script_(ru)', \"Category:Children's television networks\": 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Children%27s_television_networks', 'Category:Russian-language television stations in Russia': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Russian-language_television_stations_in_Russia', 'Category:Short description is different from Wikidata': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Short_description_is_different_from_Wikidata', 'Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 1997': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Television_channels_and_stations_disestablished_in_1997', 'Category:Television channels and stations established in 1989': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Television_channels_and_stations_established_in_1989', 'Category:Television channels and stations established in 2007': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Television_channels_and_stations_established_in_2007', 'Category:Television companies of Russia': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Television_companies_of_Russia', 'Category:Television controversies in Russia': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Television_controversies_in_Russia', 'Category:Use dmy dates from August 2022': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_August_2022', 'Category:Wikipedia articles needing cleanup after translation from August 2022': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_cleanup_after_translation_from_August_2022', 'Category:Wikipedia articles needing cleanup after translation from Russian': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_cleanup_after_translation_from_Russian'}, 'question': 'Question: WHen did the station shut down?', 'A': '1997 [ANSWER]', 'B': '2003', 'C': '2004', 'D': '1990'}\n",

Emerson & Palmer reunited with Greg Lake for 1992\\'s Black Moon and Berry would form Alliance.\\nThey performed live, as \"Emerson and Palmer\" (Berry was onstage but unnamed), at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert in 1988, broadcast on HBO, but only performed a long medley instrumental set including Fanfare for the Common Man, Leonard Bernstein\\'s America, and Dave Brubeck\\'s Blue Rondo, which later became an ELP encore in their 1990s concerts. They did not perform any original ELP material without Lake, nor did they perform any 3 songs since the band\\'s label was Geffen Records.3 performed at live venues to support their album, sometime in 1988. The three studio musicians were sometimes augmented by Paul Keller on guitar, Debra Parks and Jennifer Steele on backing vocals. Their setlist mainly consisted of material from their album, including \"Runaway\" and an extended jam version of the cover song \"Eight Miles High\". The group did a different arrangement of \"Desde La Vida\". The band did long instrumental jams based on music ELP covered including \"Hoedown\" & \"Fanfare for the Common Man\", but did not do any original ELP compositions. A long, elaborate cover of The Four Tops\\' \"Standing in the Shadows of Love\" was also included in the set.Two live albums were released many years later, both on Rock Beat Records: Live Boston 88 (2015) and Live - Rockin\\' The Ritz (2017).\\nIn October 2015, Emerson and Berry signed a contract with Frontiers Records to record a follow-up album at last, to be called 3.2. Emerson\\'s death in March of the following year put a halt to that project. However, in July 2018, Berry released (as 3.2) The Rules Have Changed, built from musical ideas contributed by Emerson, but produced and performed entirely by Berry. A second 3.2 album, Third Impression, was released in 2021.', 'categories': {'Category:All articles needing additional references': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references', 'Category:All articles with unsourced statements': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements', 'Category:Articles needing additional references from December 2009': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_December_2009', 'Category:Articles with GND identifiers': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_GND_identifiers', 'Category:Articles with ISNI identifiers': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_ISNI_identifiers', 'Category:Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_MusicBrainz_identifiers', 'Category:Articles with SUDOC identifiers': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_SUDOC_identifiers', 'Category:Articles with VIAF identifiers': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_VIAF_identifiers', 'Category:Articles with hCards': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards', 'Category:Articles with short description': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_short_description', 'Category:Articles with unsourced statements from December 2014': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_December_2014', 'Category:British supergroups': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:British_supergroups', 'Category:English musical trios': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:English_musical_trios', 'Category:English progressive rock groups': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:English_progressive_rock_groups', 'Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1989': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Musical_groups_disestablished_in_1989', 'Category:Musical groups established in 1988': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Musical_groups_established_in_1988', 'Category:Rock music supergroups': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Rock_music_supergroups', 'Category:Short description is different from Wikidata': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Short_description_is_different_from_Wikidata', 'Category:Use British English from September 2010': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Use_British_English_from_September_2010', 'Category:Use dmy dates from July 2016': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_July_2016'}, 'question': 'Question: When was the live version of the Five Tops\\' \"Standing in the Shadows of Love\" released?', 'A': 'March 2018', 'B': 'July 2018 [ANSWER]', 'C': 'March 2019', 'D': 'October 2015'}\n",

The band originally consisted of Brad Arnold (lead vocals, drums), Matt Roberts (lead guitar, backing vocals) and Todd Harrell (bass guitar), with Chris Henderson (rhythm guitar) joining in 1998. The band rose to international fame with their debut single, \"Kryptonite\" in January 2000, which placed in the top three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The band signed with Republic Records and released their debut album, The Better Life, the same year. The album was the 11th-best-selling album of that year and was certified septuple platinum in the United States. The group was later joined by drummer Richard Liles, who played during the tour for their first album.\\nThe band\\'s second album, Away from the Sun (2002), continued the band\\'s success; it debuted at number eight on the Billboard 200 chart, went multi-platinum in the U.S. like its predecessor, and spawned the hits \"When I\\'m Gone\" and \"Here Without You\". The band toured extensively for two years, performing at nearly 1,000 worldwide shows following its release. Their third and fourth albums, Seventeen Days (2005) and their eponymous album (2008) both debuted atop the Billboard 200 and received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Their fifth album, Time of My Life (2011) peaked at number three, and their sixth most recent album, Us and the Night (2016) peaked at number 14 on the chart.The band has been primarily described as post-grunge and alternative rock, while occasionally crossing into hard rock and southern rock. Their lyrical often explores themes of angst, rebellion, revenge, yearning, and abandonment. 3 Doors Down has sold 30 million albums worldwide.Original guitarist Matt Roberts departed in 2012, owing to health issues, before passing away in 2016.

      "{'_id': ObjectId('65bec5ddb60456adae102c16'), 'page_title': '3–3–5 defense', 'summary': 'In American football, the 3–3–5 defense is a defensive alignment consisting of three down linemen, three linebackers, and five defensive backs. The 3–3–5 defense can also be referred to as the 3–3 stack or the spread defense. It is one form of the nickel defense, a generic term for a formation with five defensive backs.  Veteran college football defensive coordinator Joe Lee Dunn is widely credited with being the main innovator of the 3–3–5 scheme.This alignment is generally used when the defense is trying to confuse the offense by applying different blitz pressures on the offense while playing mostly zone or sometimes man coverage. This alignment is rarely seen in the NFL, but is used by many high schools to counterattack the spread offense scheme. Boise State, West Virginia, BYU, SDSU and Arizona have used this formation with success in college football. Michigan ran this formation during the 2010 season. TCU uses this as a variant formation; its base defense is a different nickel set, the 4–2–5. In 2017 Iowa State adopted this defense as a counter to the air raid offenses commonly encountered in the Big 12 Conference.\\nTeams that run the 3–3–5 generally use it because they are a relatively fast but smaller unit compared to the opposing offense, and they want to cause blocking assignment issues for that offense. Also, a 3–3–5 can be adjusted to a 4–3, 3–4, or 4–4 defense with the same starting players.\\nTo effectively play the 3–3–5, the \"Front 8\" (i.e., the eight defensive players closest to the line of scrimmage) must be physical and tough.  The three down lineman must be able to control the running lanes, execute an effective pass rush, and be able to keep the opposing offensive line occupied so that the linebackers can make plays.  The two outside or \"Stud\" linebackers must be effective at pressuring the offensive line and reading and reacting to the play as it develops.  The middle linebacker (also known as the \"Mike\" linebacker) must be able to effectively move in the direction the play is going (also known as \"flowing to the ball\") while also being able to shed blockers and make plays.\\nThe defensive secondary must be equally capable of pressuring the offensive lineman and dropping back into pass coverage.  In the 3–3 stack version, the third safety (nicknamed the \"Aztec\" safety) must be a versatile athlete capable of dropping into coverage, pressuring the quarterback, or coming up in run support as a \"Mike\" linebacker would in a 3–4 alignment.The 3–3–5 defense is often called a \"bend but don\\'t break\" defense in that it often gives up big yardage, particularly \"between the 20s\", but gels in their Red zone (gridiron football). This is best exemplified by the 2008 West Virginia Mountaineers football defensive statistics; on average the team gave up 328 yards per game, but lead the nation in red zone efficiency, allowing their opponents to only score 68% of the time. The 3–3–5 zone coverage is often vulnerable to short and medium pass routes over the middle, particularly in the \"hole\" and \"hook\" coverage zones.', 'categories': {'Category:All articles needing additional references': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references', 'Category:American football formations': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:American_football_formations', 'Category:Articles needing additional references from January 2017': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_January_2017', 'Category:Articles with short description': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_short_description', 'Category:Short description matches Wikidata': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Short_description_matches_Wikidata', 'Category:Use mdy dates from June 2017': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Use_mdy_dates_from_June_2017', 'Category:Wikipedia articles needing clarification from April 2017': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_clarification_from_April_2017'}, 'question': 'Question: When one uses the 3-3-5 to confuse an offense, what are other names for the 3-3-5?', 'A': 'the 3–3 stack or the spread defense [ANSWER]', 'B': 'the 3–5 defense or the 3–4 defense', 'C': 'the 3–3–5 defense or the blitz defense', 'D': 'the 3–3–5 defense or the nickel defense'}\n",

Their injuries were not life-threatening, and both Chen and Lu were released from Chi-Mei Hospital on the same day without losing consciousness or undergoing surgery.\\nThe attack provoked shock and unease in Taiwan, where political violence of this kind was commonplace against non-KMT members 40 years earlier. The Taiwan dollar fell by 0.2 percent but quickly recovered.Reaction to the incident divided along partisan lines. Some including Lu pointed to Beijing and the People's Republic of China for orchestrating the attack because of her and Chen's stance supporting Taiwanese independence from the mainland. By contrast their election opponent, Lien Chan, supported by the Pan-Blue Coalition, was a supporter for integration with the mainland. The opposing Pan-Blue supporters believed that the incident was faked in order to win the sympathy of voters in the upcoming election, which Chen and Lu won by 29,500 votes. Several forensic studies, including one conducted by an American team, showed that the gun wounds were real.In August 2005, the case was officially closed with all evidence pointing to a single deceased suspect, Chen Yi-hsiung.\", 'categories': {'Category:2004 crimes in Taiwan': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2004_crimes_in_Taiwan', 'Category:All articles needing additional references': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references', 'Category:All articles with dead external links': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_dead_external_links', 'Category:All articles with unsourced statements': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements', 'Category:Articles containing traditional Chinese-language text': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_traditional_Chinese-language_text', 'Category:Articles needing additional references from June 2009': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_June_2009', 'Category:Articles with Chinese-language sources (zh)': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_Chinese-language_sources_(zh)', 'Category:Articles with dead external links from April 2019': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_dead_external_links_from_April_2019', 'Category:Articles with dead external links from July 2012': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_dead_external_links_from_July_2012', 'Category:Articles with permanently dead external links': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_permanently_dead_external_links', 'Category:Articles with short description': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_short_description', 'Category:Articles with unsourced statements from July 2012': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_July_2012', 'Category:Articles with unsourced statements from November 2020': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_November_2020', 'Category:CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:CS1_maint:_multiple_names:_authors_list', 'Category:Failed assassination attempts in Asia': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Failed_assassination_attempts_in_Asia', 'Category:History of Tainan': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:History_of_Tainan', 'Category:March 2004 events in Asia': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:March_2004_events_in_Asia', 'Category:Non-fatal shootings': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Non-fatal_shootings', 'Category:Short description is different from Wikidata': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Short_description_is_different_from_Wikidata', 'Category:Taiwan under Republic of China rule': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Taiwan_under_Republic_of_China_rule', 'Category:Violence in Taiwan': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Violence_in_Taiwan', 'Category:Webarchive template wayback links': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Webarchive_template_wayback_links'}, 'question': 'Question: What county is mentioned in a film showing the January 2003 attack?', 'A': 'Jiangsu', 'B': 'Nansha', 'C': 'Tainan [ANSWER]', 'D': 'Taiwan.'}\n",

It runs from Tavistock to 5 miles (8.0 km) north west of the city of Truro. Starting in Tavistock, it heads south-westwards towards Liskeard, crossing over the River Tamar and into Cornwall, then through Gunnislake and Callington. Immediately before Liskeard, it merges with the A38 north of the town. It diverges from the A38 at Dobwalls, where it then runs in a south-westerly direction to Truro via Lostwithiel, St. Blazey, and St Austell. It then forms an upside down elongated square loop, and bypasses Truro City Centre. It then heads north west out of the city, where it forms the main corridor into Truro from the west. It passes the Royal Cornwall Hospital and skirts the village of Threemilestone, before linking up with the A30 road at Chiverton Cross, where the A390 terminates. Chiverton Cross is where the A390 trunk road from Truro and the B3277 to St Agnes meet the east–west A30 trunk road. Before the A390 was rerouted away from Chacewater it ended at its junction with the A30 at Scorrier.It forms part of the main route (the Truro to Dobwalls section) from Truro to Plymouth, although after a severe accident in Lostwithiel in 1999 heavy goods vehicles are diverted from it at the top of Edgcumbe Road, Lostwithiel.\\nBy far the busiest section of the road is known as Truro Road between Truro City Centre and Chiverton Cross, where it carries through traffic to West Cornwall, as well as commuting traffic to and from Truro, and traffic for the Royal Cornwall Hospital, Truro College and the Richard Lander School. There are many residential new housing estates in this area which have created further traffic. The section from Truro College heading into Truro from the west also includes a Bus lane and some dual carriageway sections.', 'categories': {'Category:All articles needing additional references': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references', 'Category:Articles needing additional references from September 2012': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_September_2012', 'Category:Articles with Geo': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_Geo', 'Category:Articles with short description': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_short_description', 'Category:Commons category link from Wikidata': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Commons_category_link_from_Wikidata', 'Category:Coordinates on Wikidata': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Coordinates_on_Wikidata', 'Category:Geographic coordinate lists': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Geographic_coordinate_lists', 'Category:Infobox road instances in the United Kingdom': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Infobox_road_instances_in_the_United_Kingdom', 'Category:Infobox road maps tracking category': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Infobox_road_maps_tracking_category', 'Category:Lists of coordinates': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_coordinates', 'Category:Roads in Cornwall': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Roads_in_Cornwall', 'Category:Roads in England': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Roads_in_England', 'Category:Short description matches Wikidata': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Short_description_matches_Wikidata', 'Category:Transport in Devon': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Transport_in_Devon', 'Category:Truro': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Truro', 'Category:Use British English from February 2013': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Use_British_English_from_February_2013', 'Category:Use dmy dates from June 2023': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_June_2023'}, 'question': 'Question: Who is known for the busiest section of the road?', 'A': 'Traffic for the Royal Cornwall Hospital, Truro College and the Richard Lander School', 'B': 'Truro Road between Truro City Centre and Chiverton Cross [ANSWER]', 'C': 'None Of The Above', 'D': 'Traffic from Truro College heading into Truro'}\n"
