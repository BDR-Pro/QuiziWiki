The station was originally built by the Manhattan Railway Company on December 30, 1878, and later had two levels. The lower level serving local trains was built first, and had two tracks and two side platforms. The upper level, built as part of the Dual Contracts had one track that bypassed the station and served express trains. This station closed on May 12, 1955, with the ending of all service on the Third Avenue El south of 149th Street. South of the station were connecting tracks to the 98th Street Yard. The station was also located next to Substation 7 an old IRT substation designed not only in order to electrify the Third Avenue Line, but the Second and Ninth Avenue elevated lines as well. Later it even served as a power source for the IRT Lexington Avenue Line from 1918 until the 1970s.  The substation is still owned by the MTA and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places  since February 9, 2006.\n",

            "The 100 metres, or 100-meter dash, is a sprint race in track and field competitions. The shortest common outdoor running distance, the 100-meter (109.36 yd) dash is one of the most popular and prestigious events in the sport of athletics. It has been contested at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1928 for women. The inaugural World Championships were in 1983.\n",
            "\n",
            "The reigning 100 m Olympic or world champion is often named \"the fastest man or woman in the world\". Noah Lyles and Sha'Carri Richardson are the world champions; Marcell Jacobs and Elaine Thompson-Herah are the men's and women's Olympic champions.\n",
            "On an outdoor 400-metre running track, the 100 m is held on the home straight, with the start usually being set on an extension to make it a straight-line race. There are three instructions given to the runners immediately before and at the beginning of the race: \"on your marks\", \"set\", and the firing of the starter's pistol. The runners move to the starting blocks when they hear the 'on your marks' instruction. The following instruction, to adopt the 'set' position, allows them to adopt a more efficient starting posture and isometrically preload their muscles: this will help them to start faster. A race-official then fires the starter's pistol to signal the race beginning and the sprinters stride forwards from the blocks. Sprinters typically reach top speed after somewhere between 50 and 60 m. Their speed then slows towards the finish line.\n",
            "The 10-second barrier has historically been a barometer of fast men's performances, while the best female sprinters take eleven seconds or less to complete the race. The current men's world record is 9.58 seconds, set by Jamaica's Usain Bolt in 2009, while the women's world record is 10.49 seconds set by American Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988.\n",

The shortest common outdoor running distance, the 100-meter (109.36 yd) dash is one of the most popular and prestigious events in the sport of athletics. It has been contested at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1928 for women. The inaugural World Championships were in 1983.\\n\\nThe reigning 100 m Olympic or world champion is often named \"the fastest man or woman in the world\". Noah Lyles and Sha\\'Carri Richardson are the world champions; Marcell Jacobs and Elaine Thompson-Herah are the men\\'s and women\\'s Olympic champions.\\nOn an outdoor 400-metre running track, the 100 m is held on the home straight, with the start usually being set on an extension to make it a straight-line race. There are three instructions given to the runners immediately before and at the beginning of the race: \"on your marks\", \"set\", and the firing of the starter\\'s pistol. The runners move to the starting blocks when they hear the \\'on your marks\\' instruction. The following instruction, to adopt the \\'set\\' position, allows them to adopt a more efficient starting posture and isometrically preload their muscles: this will help them to start faster. A race-official then fires the starter\\'s pistol to signal the race beginning and the sprinters stride forwards from the blocks. Sprinters typically reach top speed after somewhere between 50 and 60 m. Their speed then slows towards the finish line.\\nThe 10-second barrier has historically been a barometer of fast men\\'s performances, while the best female sprinters take eleven seconds or less to complete the race. The current men\\'s world record is 9.58 seconds, set by Jamaica\\'s Usain Bolt in 2009, while the women\\'s world record is 10.49 seconds set by American Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988.', 'categories': {'Category:100 (number)': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:100_(number)', 'Category:100 metres': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:100_metres', 'Category:All articles containing potentially dated statements': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_containing_potentially_dated_statements', 'Category:All articles needing additional references': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references', 'Category:All articles with failed verification': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_failed_verification', 'Category:All articles with unsourced statements': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements', 'Category:Articles containing potentially dated statements from April 2022': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_potentially_dated_statements_from_April_2022', 'Category:Articles containing potentially dated statements from August 2022': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_potentially_dated_statements_from_August_2022', 'Category:Articles containing potentially dated statements from January 2024': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_potentially_dated_statements_from_January_2024', 'Category:Articles containing potentially dated statements from September 2023': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_potentially_dated_statements_from_September_2023', 'Category:Articles containing video clips': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_video_clips', 'Category:Articles needing additional references from August 2021': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_August_2021', 'Category:Articles with failed verification from January 2020': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_failed_verification_from_January_2020', 'Category:Articles with short description': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_short_description', 'Category:Articles with unsourced statements from January 2020': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_January_2020', 'Category:CS1 German-language sources (de)': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:CS1_German-language_sources_(de)', 'Category:CS1 Portuguese-language sources (pt)': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:CS1_Portuguese-language_sources_(pt)', 'Category:Commons category link from Wikidata': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Commons_category_link_from_Wikidata', 'Category:EngvarB from August 2016': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:EngvarB_from_August_2016', 'Category:Events in track and field': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Events_in_track_and_field', 'Category:Short description matches Wikidata': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Short_description_matches_Wikidata', 'Category:Sprint (running)': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Sprint_(running)', 'Category:Summer Olympic disciplines in athletics': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Summer_Olympic_disciplines_in_athletics', 'Category:Use dmy dates from May 2020': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_May_2020'}, 'question': 'Question: What is one of the most popular and prestigious events in the sport of athletics?\\n[A] The 100 metres and 400 metres\\n[B] The 100 metres and 400 metres\\n[C] The 100 metres [ANSWER]\\n[D] The 100 metres and 500 metres'}\n",

            "The 100 metres at the Summer Olympics has been contested since the first edition of the multi-sport event. The men's 100 metres has been present on the Olympic athletics programme since 1896. The 100 metres is considered one of the blue ribbon events of the Olympics and is among the highest profile competitions at the games. It is the most prestigious 100 metres race at an elite level and is the shortest sprinting competition at the Olympics – a position it has held at every edition except for a brief period between 1900 and 1904, when a men's 60 metres was contested.The first Olympic champions were Thomas Burke in the men's category and, 32 years later, Betty Robinson in the women's category. The Olympic records for the event are 9.63 seconds, set by Usain Bolt in 2012, and 10.61 seconds, set by Elaine Thompson-Herah in 2021. The world records for the event have been equalled or broken during the Olympics on seven occasions in the men's category and on twelve occasions in the women's.Among the competing nations, the United States has had the most success in this event, having won sixteen golds in the men's race and nine in the women's race. Usain Bolt of Jamaica has won three consecutive titles (2008–16). Five other athletes have won back-to-back titles: Wyomia Tyus (1964–68), Carl Lewis (1984–88), Gail Devers (1992–96), Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (2008–12), and Elaine Thompson-Herah (2016-2020). Merlene Ottey is the only athlete to win three medals without winning gold, with one silver and two bronze medals. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is the most decorated athlete in the event, male or female, having won 4 medals.Many athletes that compete in this event also compete individually in the Olympic 200 metres and with their national teams in the Olympic 4×100 metres relay, with Jamaicans Usain Bolt and Elaine Thompson-Herah being the only athletes to do so more than once. Nine men have achieved the 100 metres and 200 metres 'Double' at the same Olympic Games - Archie Hahn (1904), Ralph Craig (1912), Percy Williams (1928), Eddie Tolan (1932), Jesse Owens (1936), Bobby Morrow (1956), Valeriy Borzov (1972), Carl Lewis (1984), and Usain Bolt (2008, 2012, 2016). Four of these men were also members of the winning team in the 4 × 100 meters relay at the same games - Jesse Owens (1936), Bobby Morrow (1956), Carl Lewis (1984), and Usain Bolt (2012, 2016). Three of these men have won a fourth gold medal at the same games - Archie Hahn in the now defunct 60 metres, and both Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis in the long jump.\n",
            "Seven women have achieved the 100 metres and 200 metres 'Double' at the same Olympic Games - Fanny Blankers-Koen (1948), Marjorie Jackson (1952), Betty Cuthbert (1956), Wilma Rudolph (1960), Renate Stecher (1972), Florence Griffith-Joyner (1988), and Elaine Thompson-Herah (2016) and (2021).

It is stationed at RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk, United Kingdom. It is also the host wing at RAF Mildenhall.\\nThe 100th ARW is the only permanent U.S. air refueling wing in the European theater, operating the Boeing KC-135R/T Stratotanker.\\nDuring World War II, its predecessor unit, the 100th Bombardment Group (Heavy), was an Eighth Air Force B-17 Flying Fortress unit in England, stationed at RAF Thorpe Abbotts. Flying over 300 combat missions, the group earned two Distinguished Unit Citations (Regensburg, 17 August 1943; Berlin, 4/6/8 March 1944). The group suffered tremendous losses in combat, with 177 aircraft missing in action (MIA), flying its last mission on 20 April 1945.\\nOne of the wing's honors is that it is the only modern USAF operational wing allowed to display on its assigned aircraft the tail code (Square-D) of its World War II predecessor. The 379th Bomb Wing used its Triangle-K tail code until inactivated in 1993, but when reactivated as the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing was assigned a rotating mix of flying squadrons who used their parent unit's tail code. The Triangle-K is retained as an unofficial unit insignia.\", 'categories': {'Category:1942 establishments in Florida': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1942_establishments_in_Florida', 'Category:1949 disestablishments in Florida': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1949_disestablishments_in_Florida', 'Category:1956 establishments in New Hampshire': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1956_establishments_in_New_Hampshire', 'Category:Air refueling wings of the United States Air Force': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Air_refueling_wings_of_the_United_States_Air_Force', 'Category:All articles needing additional references': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references', 'Category:Articles needing additional references from October 2012': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_October_2012', 'Category:Articles with ISNI identifiers': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_ISNI_identifiers', 'Category:Articles with short description': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_short_description', 'Category:Commons category link from Wikidata': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Commons_category_link_from_Wikidata', 'Category:Military units and formations established in 1942': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Military_units_and_formations_established_in_1942', 'Category:Military units and formations established in 1956': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Military_units_and_formations_established_in_1956', 'Category:Pages with empty portal template': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Pages_with_empty_portal_template', 'Category:Portal templates with redlinked portals': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Portal_templates_with_redlinked_portals', 'Category:Short description is different from Wikidata': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Short_description_is_different_from_Wikidata', 'Category:Units and formations of Strategic Air Command': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Units_and_formations_of_Strategic_Air_Command', 'Category:Use dmy dates from June 2020': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_June_2020', 'Category:Webarchive template wayback links': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Webarchive_template_wayback_links', 'Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the Air Force Historical Research Agency': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_text_from_the_Air_Force_Historical_Research_Agency'}, 'question': 'Question: How many aircraft were MIA?\\n[A] 379 aircraft\\n[B] 2 aircraft\\n[C] 300 aircraft\\n[D] 177 aircraft [ANSWER]'}\n",

The 101 Ranch Wild West Show was one of the last of the large Wild West shows. The history spans from 1841, Col.

At its height, the ranch encompassed more than 110,000 acres (450 km2) in parts of Noble, Pawnee, Osage, and Kay counties in north central Oklahoma.  The appendices list the legal description of the land owned by the ranch as well as its Indian leases. The book contains some 53 photographs depicting the family, the work on the ranch, the Wild West show, as well as the many cowboys, noted visitors, and many Indians employed or living on the ranch.\n",

At its height, the ranch encompassed more than 110,000 acres (450 km2) in parts of Noble, Pawnee, Osage, and Kay counties in north central Oklahoma.  The appendices list the legal description of the land owned by the ranch as well as its Indian leases. The book contains some 53 photographs depicting the family, the work on the ranch, the Wild West show, as well as the many cowboys, noted visitors, and many Indians employed or living on the ranch.\n",

            "The 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) (\"Screaming Eagles\") is a light infantry division of the United States Army that specializes in air assault operations. It can plan, coordinate, and execute multiple battalion-size air assault operations to seize terrain. These operations can be conducted by mobile teams covering large distances, fighting behind enemy lines, and working in austere environments with limited or degraded infrastructure. It was active in, for example, foreign internal defense and counterterrorism operations in Iraq, in Afghanistan in 2015–2016, and in Syria, as part of Operation Inherent Resolve in 2018–2021.\n",
            "Established in 1918, the 101st Division was first constituted as an airborne unit in 1942. During World War II, it gained renown for its role in Operation Overlord (the D-Day landings and airborne landings on 6 June 1944, in Normandy, France); Operation Market Garden; the liberation of the Netherlands; and its action during the Battle of the Bulge around the city of Bastogne, Belgium. During the Vietnam War, the 101st Airborne Division fought in several major campaigns and battles, including the Battle of Hamburger Hill in May 1969. In mid-1968, the division was reorganized and redesignated as an airmobile division; in 1974, as an air assault division. The titles reflect the division's shift from airplanes to helicopters as the primary method of delivering troops into combat.\n",
            "At the height of the War on Terror, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) had over 200 aircraft. This shrank to just over 100 aircraft with the inactivation of the 159th Combat Aviation Brigade in 2015, making it no different in configuration from the Army's other light infantry divisions. In 2019, media reports suggested the Army was working to restore the 101st's aviation capabilities so it can return to lifting an entire brigade in one air assault operation.The 101st's headquarters is at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Many current members of the 101st are graduates of the U.S. Army Air Assault School, which is co-located with the division. The school is known as one of the Army's most difficult courses; only about half of those who begin it graduate.The Screaming Eagles was referred to as \"the tip of the spear\" by former U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, and the most potent and tactically mobile of the U.S. Army's divisions by General Edward C.

It can plan, coordinate, and execute multiple battalion-size air assault operations to seize terrain. These operations can be conducted by mobile teams covering large distances, fighting behind enemy lines, and working in austere environments with limited or degraded infrastructure. It was active in, for example, foreign internal defense and counterterrorism operations in Iraq, in Afghanistan in 2015–2016, and in Syria, as part of Operation Inherent Resolve in 2018–2021.\\nEstablished in 1918, the 101st Division was first constituted as an airborne unit in 1942. During World War II, it gained renown for its role in Operation Overlord (the D-Day landings and airborne landings on 6 June 1944, in Normandy, France); Operation Market Garden; the liberation of the Netherlands; and its action during the Battle of the Bulge around the city of Bastogne, Belgium. During the Vietnam War, the 101st Airborne Division fought in several major campaigns and battles, including the Battle of Hamburger Hill in May 1969. In mid-1968, the division was reorganized and redesignated as an airmobile division; in 1974, as an air assault division. The titles reflect the division\\'s shift from airplanes to helicopters as the primary method of delivering troops into combat.\\nAt the height of the War on Terror, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) had over 200 aircraft. This shrank to just over 100 aircraft with the inactivation of the 159th Combat Aviation Brigade in 2015, making it no different in configuration from the Army\\'s other light infantry divisions. In 2019, media reports suggested the Army was working to restore the 101st\\'s aviation capabilities so it can return to lifting an entire brigade in one air assault operation.The 101st\\'s headquarters is at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Many current members of the 101st are graduates of the U.S. Army Air Assault School, which is co-located with the division. The school is known as one of the Army\\'s most difficult courses; only about half of those who begin it graduate.The Screaming Eagles was referred to as \"the tip of the spear\" by former U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, and the most potent and tactically mobile of the U.S. Army\\'s divisions by General Edward C. Meyer, then Chief of Staff of the Army.', 'categories': {'Category:101st Airborne Division': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:101st_Airborne_Division', 'Category:1942 establishments in the
